# Kalos Timer

An attempt at making a Kalos timer system that is functionally similar to the one that is found [here](https://saltette.github.io/) but using a library that can capture all keyboard input. Luckily, somebody designed such a library for Python, and, since GUI design seems to be fairly simple on Python, I figured it would be worth it to create a timer with customizable hotkeys that trigger effects without requiring focus or eating any inputs.

### Libraries Required
* PIL
* keyboard
